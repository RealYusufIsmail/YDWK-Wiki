# Getting started with YDWK

YDWK is a discord wrapper made in kotlin that aims to be as simple and as fast as possible while still being easy to use and understand. It is built to be similar to discord.js but with some differences. It tries to adhere to the [discord api](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) as much as possible.

## Structure

The way the docs are structured is as follows:

- [Getting started](/docs/docs/README.md) - This page
- [JConfig](/docs/docs/jconfig) - Everything you need to know about JConfig
- [Tutorial](/docs/docs/tutorial) - A brief tutorial on how to use YDWK such as creating a bot and sending a message
- [Gateway](/docs/docs/gateway) - Key information about the gateway such as intents, events and cache. Also contains a list of all events and talks about how to use them

If you have any questions, feel free to join the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/PCz8ET778U) or open an issue on [github](https://github.com/YDWK/YDWK/issues/new/choose).
